            "content": "# React Todo App Load Todos\n\nYou goal is to implement a simple Todo App that will save all changes to [the API](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-students-api/).\n\n> Here is [the working example](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_todo-app-with-api/)\n\nThe task consists of 3 part:\n- (This repo) [Load todos](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_todo-app-loading-todos)\n- [Add and Delete](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_todo-app-add-and-delete)\n- [Toggle and Rename](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_todo-app-with-api)\n\nIn this 1st part you will:\n\n- learn the markup in `App.tsx`\n- learn `src/utils/fetchClient.ts` implementations and use it (or delete use any other approaches to interact with API)\n- implement todos loading\n- implement error messages\n- implement filtering by status\n- copy the final code to [the 2nd part](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_todo-app-add-and-delete)\n\n## General principles\n\n> Keep your logic as simple as possible!\n\nImprove user experience:\n- hide or disable elements that can't be used at the moment\n- focus text fields, so user could start typing without extra clicks\n- prevents users from doing the same action twice accidentally (disable controls when action is in progress)\n- show spinners on todos immediately to notify the user that action is in progress\n- update todos only after successful save to the API (tests expect such behaviour)\n- in case of any error show a notification (and hide it after delay)\n- clear input values on `success` and preserve and focus on `error`\n\n## Tests\n\nTests help you to check if your implementation is correct.\n\n- tests are grouped by functionality\n- `.skip` after `it` or `describe` disables a test or a group of tests\n- if you don't understand the test by its name, read its code in `cypress/integration/page.js`\n- if you can't fix failed test ask mentors for help\n- delays are important for tests, so make sure every request has `100` - `200` ms delay\n\n## Load Todos by userID\n\n1. Register a user by your email [here](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_student-registration/)\n1. Save the received `userId` in the `api/todos.ts` and use it to load todos\n1. reate some todos using the [Demo Page](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_todo-app-with-api/)\n1. Load your todos when the `App` is loaded\n1. hide the list and the footer if there are no todos yet;\n\n## Show Error Messages\n\nIn case of any error show the notification with an appropriate message at the bottom\n\n- the notification can be closed with the `close` button (add the `hidden` class, **DON'T** use conditional rendering);\n- automatically hide the notification after 3 seconds;\n- hide the notification before any next request;\n\nYou can use a wrong todos URL to test the error.\n\n## Filter Todos by Status\n\nFilter todos by status `All` / `Active` / `Completed`:\n\n- all todos should be visible by default\n- use the `selected` class to highlight a selected link;\n\n## Common Instructions\n- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.\n- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).\n- Use the [React TypeScript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript).\n- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://.github.io/react_todo-app-loading-todos/) and add it to the PR description.\n"
